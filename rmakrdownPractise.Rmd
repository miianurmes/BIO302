## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars,warning=FALSE}
# Title 
library(tidyverse)#purrr is part of tidyverse
my_data <- excel_sheets(path = "biomass2015.xls") %>% 
    map_dfr(~read_excel(path = "biomass2015.xls", sheet =.x)) 
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
my_data <- my_data %>%
  select(c(site, plot, production)) %>% #select columns from dataset
  dplyr::mutate(site = factor
                (site, levels = c("L", "M", "A", "H"))) %>% #make r recognise site as 4 levels
  group_by(site, plot) %>%  #group the variables by site and by plot
  summarise(Biomass = sum(production, na.rm = T)) 

```
```{r}
p1<- ggplot(my_data, aes (x=site, y=Biomass, colour=site))+
  geom_boxplot()
p1
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
